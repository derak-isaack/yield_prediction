# XGBoost

## This is a machine Learning model that uses XGBoost to predict the yield of wild berry fruits taking into consideration all the factors that affect the final yield.
## The model has a run time of 15 seconds with an accuracy score of 81%.
## The png file shows the importance of features which affect yield in order of seniority in a graph-like format.
## The model has also undergone hyperparameter tuning to ensure a better accuracy score.
## I used XGBoost because it offers more scalability when dealing with large datasets.
